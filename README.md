# Minimig AGA
For Turbo Chameleon TC64, MiST and other platforms.
(This core should be easily portable to any FPGA board with VGA out, PS/2 in, SD-card, about 25,000 logic elements, and a 16-bit wide SDRAM supporting 13x9 layout for 32 megabytes of RAM.)

### Foreword

[minimig](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimig) (short for Mini Amiga) is an open source re-implementation of an Amiga using a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). Original minimig author is Dennis van Weeren.

[Amiga](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_500) was an amazing personal computer, announced around 1984, which - at the time - far surpassed any other personal computer on the market, with advanced graphic & sound capabilities, not to mention its great OS with preemptive multitasking capabilities.

This minimig variant has been upgraded with [AGA chipset](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_Advanced_Graphics_Architecture) capabilites, which allows it to emulate the latest Amiga models ([Amiga 1200](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_1200), [Amiga 4000](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_4000) and (partially) [Amiga CD32](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_CD32)). Ofcourse it also supports previous OCS/ECS Amigas like [Amiga 500](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_500), [Amiga 600](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_600) etc.


## Core features supported

* chipset variants : OCS, ECS, AGA
* chipRAM : 0.5MB - 2.0MB
* slowRAM : 0.0MB - 1.5MB
* fastRAM : 0.0MB - 24MB
* CPU core : 68000, 68010, 68020
* kickstart : 1.2 - 3.1 (256kB, 512kB & 1MB kickstart ROMs currently supported)
* HRTmon with custom registers mirror
* floppy disks : 1-4 floppies (supports ADF floppy image format), with normal & turbo speeds
* hard disks : 1-2 hard disk images (supports whole disk images, partition images, using whole SD card and using SD card partition)
* video standard : PAL / NTSC
* supports normal & scandoubled video output (15kHz / 30kHz) - can be used with a monitor or a TV with a SCART cable
* peripherals : real Amiga / C64 joysticks connected to C64 joystick ports, CDTV infra-red controllers, PS/2 keyboards,
PS/2 mice, Turbo Chameleon Docking Station for extra joysticks or real Amiga mouse, and MIDI in / out
* supports basic retargetable graphics with a P96 driver
* has an implementation of the Akiko chunky to planar converter
* has an extra audio channel which can be used from the Amiga to play CD-quality WAV files, or used on some platforms to emulate floppy drive sounds.


## Usage

### Hardware
To use this minimig core, you will at the minimum need an SD/SDHC card, formatted with the FAT32 filesystem, a PS/2 keyboard and a compatible monitor / TV. Joysticks & mouse can be emulated on the keyboard. You will probably want to attach a set of speakers of headphones, a real Amiga or USB mouse and a real Amiga joystick.

### Software

To use the core, you will also need a Kickstart ROM image file, which you can obtain by copying Kickstart ROM IC from your actual Amiga, or by buying an [Amiga Forever](http://www.amigaforever.com/) software pack. The Kickstart image should be placed on the root of the SD card with the name KICK.ROM. Minimig also supports the [AROS](http://aros.sourceforge.net/) kickstart ROM replacement.

The minimig can read any ADF floppy images you place on the SD card. I recommend at least Workbench 1.3 or 3.1 (AmigaOS), some of the Amigas great games (I recommend Ruff'n'Tumble) or some of the amazing demos from the vast Amiga demoscene (like State of the Art from Spaceballs).

The minimig can also use HDF harddisk images, which can be created with [WinUAE](http://www.winuae.net/).

### Recommended minimig config

* for ECS games / demos : CPU = 68000, Turbo=NONE, Chipset=ECS, chipRAM=0.5MB, slowRAM=0.5MB, Kickstart 1.3
* for AGA games / demos : CPU = 68020, Turbo=NONE, Chipset=AGA, chipRAM=2MB, slowRAM=0MB, fastRAM=24MB, Kickstart 3.1
For Workbench usage, you can try turning TURBO=BOTH for a little speed increase.

### Controlling minimig

Keyboard special keys:

* F12         - OSD menu
* F11         - start monitor (HRTmon) if HRTmon is enabled in OSD menu (otherwise F11 is the Amiga HELP key)
* ScrollLock  - toggle keyoard only / mouse / joystick 1 / joystick 2 emulation on the keyboard (direction keys + LCTRL)

## Building minimig-mist from sources

* checkout the source 
* cd into the project directory
* Make sure vivado settings64.sh has been sourced into the shell ``source <vivado home>/Vivado/2020.2/settings64.sh``
* run 'rebuild.sh'
* Open the project in Vivado, proceed with the build by pressing 'Generate bitstream'
* wait until the status in the top right corner indicates that the build is finished
* in 'PROGRAM AND DEBUG', unfold 'Open Hardware Manager'
* click 'Open Target' (Make sure the FPGA is connected via the programmer at this point)
* select 'auto connect'

## Building firmware

First build the compiler and patch it.
Luckily there is a Makefile making the process simpler.

```bash
cd EightThirtyTwo
make
<Some output>
cd ..
```

After that build the firmware itself.
The build process yields a file called: 832OSDAD.BIN
The 832OSDAD.BIN is copied to the micro sd card the Open AARS boots from.

```bash
cd fw/ctrl_832
make
cp 832OSDAD.bin <root of sd card>/832OSDAD.BIN
```

Files needed for the Open AARS to boot

|name|description|
|---|---|
|832OSDAD.BIN|Firmware responsible for the On screen display|
|kick.rom|Default kickstart rom|
|hrtmon.rom*|Hardware monitor rom|
|rom.key*|If Amiga Forever rom files are used, this key file is needed|
|minimig.art*|Spining ball logo at boot time|
|hardfile.hdf|Harddisk image, can be created using UAE|

## Sources

This sourcecode is based on Rok's previous project ([minimig-de1](https://github.com/rkrajnc/minimig-de1)), and it continues from there. It was split into a new project to allow changes that would never fit in the FPGA on the DE1 board.
